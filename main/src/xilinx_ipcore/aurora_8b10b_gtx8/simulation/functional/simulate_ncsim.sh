## SIMULATE_NCSIM.SH
##
##
## Description: A .sh file to run a simulation using the aurora_8b10b_gtx8_exdes module,
##              an example design which instantiates aurora_8b10b_gtx8.
##
##              Ensure the follwoing:
##              The library paths for UNISIMS_VER, SIMPRIMS_VER, XILINXCORELIB_VER,
##              UNISIM, SIMPRIM, XILINXCORELIB are set correctly in the cds.lib and
##              hdl.var files.
##              Variables LMC_HOME and XILINX are set
##              Define the mapping for the work library in cds.lib file.
##              DEFINE work ./work
##
